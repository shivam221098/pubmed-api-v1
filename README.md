# Problem Statement

Due to recent changes in PubMed API policies, they don't allow users get more than 10k results, resulting 
in results capping against search strings.

# Solution #1
1. `edirect` - edirect is a command-line utility. It provides capabilities of fetching PMIDs against a 
search string when `esearch` and `efetch` commands are piped together.

# Problems with `edirect`
1. On the official documentation, it says we can't pull more than 10k PMIDs for the `pubmed` database and
if we want more than 10k PMIDs, then we have to use `edirect`, because `edirect` has additional logic to batch pubmed 
results.

2. In my opinion, `edirect` works great, but when it has to be integrated with another app then it becomes 
complex to use. Setting up `edirect` in different environment or platform is also complex.

3. While running `edirect` on the terminal, it requires some ascii characters to be escaped like `(`.

# Solution #2
1. Running pubmed API on search strings with some date-ranges. But sometimes even a single day has more than 10k PMIDs

# Solution #3

Instead of using `edirect` or concept of date-ranges, let's divide the search strings results in ranges of PMIDs.

#### Algorithm
1. Take a usual string and run over PubMed API. It will get some PMIDs and Count of actual PMIDs this search string
can get from the pubmed db.
2. The returned results are by default sorted on the basis of most recent articles. In essence, the most recent PMID is
returned in the very first API call. So, take the maximum PMID as this PMID is the most is most recent.
3. If the returned PMIDs count (counted PMIDs from response) <= actual counts `<Counts>47851</Counts>` mentioned in the API response. Then our first API call is the required result.
4. If not, then divide the maximum PMID from `Step 2` by `2`. It will give you two halves. 
First from `1` to `max_pmid / 2` and second from `max_pmid / 2` to `max_pmid`. 
5. Now, change the original search string as follows:

Suppose `max_pmid = 15000`

Suppose our search string is `"human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)"`, so, two new search strings will be
`"human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)" AND 1:7500[UID]` and `"human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)" AND 7500:15000[UID]`
Now, Run these two string over the API and repeat `Step 3` for each new string.

This way we can grab all PMIDs using API, without shifting to any other new tool.

If you see we are dividing each sets into two halves recursively. That means PMIDs from range `1` to `x` can be fetched
in an API call and the minimum `x` can go is `1`. We are using same concept of date ranges but dividing sets into halves
using PMID itself. This way the issue of more than 10k PMIDs in a day can be corrected, and it's far simpler than
using `edirect` on the terminal. 

The above process takes only `41 Seconds` for `106K` PMIDs.

#### The edirect actually uses the PubMed API to get the results, but how it is able to get the results from PubMed API if it is using the same API? ðŸ¤”
#### Actually it uses the same above concept to get the results from API. ðŸŽ‰


# Usage
### To get PMIDs for a search string
```python
from pubmed import PubMedAPI


pa = PubMedAPI()  # instantiate once and use it for n number of search terms
search_terms = [
    '"parkinson\'s disease"',
    '"human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)"'
]

for term in search_terms:
    result = pa.extract(term)  # result will the object of ResultSet()
    print(result.pmids)  # will return list of PMIDs (list)
    print(result.record_count)  # will return number if PMIDs (int)
```
